# Face Shape Analyzer
A mobile application that analyzes the face shape.

The human face can be broadly classified into 4 major types. Ofcourse there are plenty of variations because each person is unique. The major face shape categories are:


1.Square

2.Heart 

3.Oval

4.Round 



This app uses Convolution Neural Networks(CNNs) to analyze and determine the shape of a person's face.

# Test
By looking at this photo, you would say that the face shape is oval. This inference can change from person to person. Let's see what result the CNN gives us.
